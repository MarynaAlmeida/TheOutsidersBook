<h4>Information About the Writer</h4>

<h4 style="font-size:100%;"> Writer: Susan Eloise Hinton (S.E Hinton)</h4>

<p class="first">S.E Hinton was born in July 22 of 1948 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. She wrote The Outsiders while still a junior in high school 
 in 1967. Now she's 73 years old and has written nine publishe books.</p>

 <p class="first">Hinton used her initials instead of her full name due to concers that readers and reviewers alike would automatically dismiss a book about teenage boys written by a teenage girl.</p>
 
<p class="first">Hinton got inspired to do the book because of rival gangs at her high school, Will Rogers High School. She wrote about two gangs, the lower class
    "Greasers" and the upper class "Socs(Socials)". Althought Hinton was neither a Greaser nor a Soc, the book is written from the point of view of the Greaser Ponyboy in an effort 
    to humanize the gang. However, Hinton also refrains from vilifying the Socs, a choice that reflected her belief that things are "rough all over".
</p>
 
<p class="first">The sucess of The Outsiders put a lot of pressure on Hinton, and the stress initially inhibited her progress on a follow-up book. To combat this writer's block, her boyfriend suggested that Hinton writer
    just two pages a day. It must have worked because her next novel, <strong>That Was Then, This Is Now</strong> was released in 1971.
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
 
<p class="first">She(Hinton) wrote the book from a male point of view because male characters was easiest for her. Most of her close friends were boys, so she knew how boys were, their ideas and thoughts. 
    She kept using male characters because boys have fewer books written for them, and it was what she felt comfortable of writting.
